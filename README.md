# SimpleWebPack
A Simple WebPack CSS HTML Template/Starter Kit Project

This is starter kit project to build simple HTML/CSS websites. Not so heavy on Javascript.

I didn't find a starter project when all I wanted was a Simple HTML page with some CSS added.
(I wanted to use SASS instead of plain CSS).

This project uses Bulma as CSS framework; You can remove it or replace it with another framework.

## Files
* src/index.html is just copied to the dist folder
* src/script/index.js is built to js/bundle.js
* src/style/styles.scss is compiled to css/styles.css


To build the project, run 

```bash
$ npm run build
```
This will place the output files in the folder dist

```bash
$ npm start
```
Opens the project in browser (http://localhost:8080)
